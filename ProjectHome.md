This tool is for simplifying the procedure of editing fst.bin.

Editing fst.bin in a Hex editor is error-prone, a typo when changing offset of size of file will crash the game. The fst Reader no only shows you the content of fst.bin files in a GUI, you can easily copy and paste entry info within the tree view.

This program requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run. If you can run java applet in your browser, you can start this program by doubling clicking the "fstReader.jar" file.
